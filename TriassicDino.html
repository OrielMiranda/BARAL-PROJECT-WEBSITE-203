Its teeth suggest it may have been omnivorous, capable of eating both plants and small animals. Fossils were discovered in the Maleri Formation of central India, and the dinosaur was named in honor of British paleontologist Alick Walker. Because the remains are fragmentary, scientists still debate its exact classification, though it is generally regarded as a basal saurischian, showing features common to the earliest dinosaurs."

Unlike the later gigantic sauropods of the Jurassic, Lessemsaurus still showed primitive features, bridging the evolutionary gap between early sauropodomorphs (‚Äúprosauropods‚Äù) and the true sauropods. It likely fed on cycads, conifers, and other tall vegetation, using its long neck to browse higher plants. Fossils of this dinosaur were found in the Los Colorados Formation of Argentina, an area rich in Triassic fauna."

Melanorosaurus could grow up to 8‚Äì12 meters (26‚Äì40 feet) long and weighed several tons, making it much larger than most other Triassic dinosaurs. Unlike the smaller, more lightly built early sauropodomorphs, it had a robust body, column-like limbs, and a long neck, traits that foreshadow the massive sauropods of the Jurassic. It was a herbivore, feeding on cycads, conifers, and other Triassic vegetation. Fossils were first discovered in South Africa‚Äôs Elliot Formation, and the name means ‚ÄúBlack Mountain lizard‚Äù, after the Melanoros area where it was found."

Asylosaurus was about 2 meters (6.5 feet) long, lightly built, and primarily herbivorous, though it may have been omnivorous like some other early sauropodomorphs. It had a long neck, small head, and grasping hands with claws, which may have helped it feed on plants or small prey. The name means ‚Äúunharmed lizard‚Äù, given because its fossil bones survived unscathed during World War II bombings in Bristol, where they were stored. Its remains, found in the Avon region of England, represent one of the earliest known dinosaurs from the UK, highlighting how early sauropodomorphs spread across Pangaea."

Chindesaurus measured about 2‚Äì2.5 meters (6.5‚Äì8 feet) long, with a lightweight, agile build suited for running and hunting. It had sharp teeth, grasping hands, and a long tail for balance, making it one of the earliest predatory dinosaurs in North America. Its fossils were found in the Chinle Formation, and its name means ‚ÄúChinde lizard‚Äù, referencing the Navajo word chindi (spirit or ghost). Paleontologists debate whether it was a true theropod or closer to the early saurischian ancestors that eventually gave rise to theropods, showing how diverse and experimental dinosaur evolution was in the Triassic."

Daemonosaurus was about 1.5‚Äì2 meters (5‚Äì6.5 feet) long, with a lightly built body adapted for running and hunting small prey. Unlike most early theropods with long, slender skulls, it had a short, boxy snout filled with sharp, forward-projecting teeth, giving it a unique and somewhat ‚Äúdemonic‚Äù appearance‚Äîhence its name, which means ‚Äúdemon lizard.‚Äù Its discovery in the Ghost Ranch quarry (New Mexico) showed that unusual early theropods survived alongside more advanced dinosaur groups late into the Triassic. This makes Daemonosaurus an important piece in understanding the evolutionary experiments of early meat-eating dinosaurs."

Staurikosaurus was relatively small, about 2 meters (6.5 feet) long and weighing around 30 kilograms (65 pounds). It had a slender, agile body, long legs for fast running, and sharp, curved teeth suited for slicing meat. Its long tail, making up more than half its body length, likely helped with balance while chasing prey. As a carnivore, it probably hunted small reptiles and early mammals. The name means ‚ÄúSouthern Cross lizard‚Äù, after the constellation Crux, a national symbol of Brazil. Its fossils, found in the Santa Maria Formation of Brazil, provide crucial evidence of some of the earliest theropod evolution, showing the beginnings of traits that would later dominate predatory dinosaurs."

Coloradisaurus measured about 4 meters (13 feet) long, much smaller than later sauropods, and was lightly built with a long neck, small head, and grasping hands that may have helped it feed on plants. Its diet likely consisted of cycads, ferns, and early conifers. The fossils were discovered in the Los Colorados Formation (hence the name, meaning ‚Äúlizard from Los Colorados‚Äù) in Argentina. Originally mistaken for Plateosaurus, later studies confirmed it was a distinct genus. It represents the transitional stage between the smaller, more agile sauropodomorphs and the gigantic sauropods that would dominate the Jurassic."

Eoraptor was about 1 meter (3.3 feet) long and lightly built, with long legs for speed, grasping hands, and a slender tail for balance. Unlike many later theropods, its teeth were a mix of serrated (meat-cutting) and leaf-shaped (plant-chewing) forms, suggesting it was omnivorous‚Äîfeeding on insects, small vertebrates, and plants. Its fossils were found in the Ischigualasto Formation in northwestern Argentina, an area rich with early dinosaur remains. Paleontologists consider Eoraptor a basal saurischian, close to the common ancestor of both theropods (meat-eaters) and sauropodomorphs (long-necked plant-eaters). Because of this, Eoraptor is often described as a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù into the earliest stages of dinosaur evolution, showing the small, generalist body plan from which later giants evolved."

Camposaurus measured about 2 meters (6.5 feet) long and had a slender, lightweight frame built for speed and agility. It was a predator, using its sharp teeth and grasping hands to catch small vertebrates and early reptiles. Its fossils, mainly leg bones, were found in the Chinle Formation, which is the same formation that produced other early dinosaurs like Chindesaurus. For many years, its classification was uncertain, but later studies confirmed it as a theropod closely related to Coelophysis. This makes Camposaurus an important dinosaur for understanding the early diversification of theropods in North America."

Thecodontosaurus grew to about 2 meters (6.5 feet) long, making it modest in size compared to its later giant sauropod relatives. It had a long neck and tail, grasping hands, and slender limbs, suggesting it could move both on two legs and four. Its teeth were leaf-shaped and serrated, adapted for eating plants such as cycads and early conifers, although it may have also eaten small animals occasionally. The name means ‚Äúsocket-toothed lizard‚Äù, because its teeth were set in distinct sockets‚Äîa feature linking it to later dinosaurs. Fossils were first found in Bristol, England, making it the first dinosaur discovered in the UK and one of the earliest known sauropodomorphs."

Guaibasaurus measured about 2 meters (6.5 feet) long and had a slender, agile body, long tail, and strong hind limbs, making it a fast runner. Its skull and teeth suggest it was carnivorous or omnivorous, feeding on small animals and possibly insects. Fossils were discovered in the Caturrita Formation of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in the late 1990s. Paleontologists consider Guaibasaurus especially important because its anatomy shows a mix of traits found in both theropods (meat-eaters) and sauropodomorphs (plant-eaters). This has led some scientists to propose that it represents one of the earliest branches of the saurischian dinosaurs, offering clues about how the two great lineages of saurischians began to diverge."

Its name means ‚Äúhollow form,‚Äù referring to its hollow bones. Coelophysis measured about 2‚Äì3 meters (6.5‚Äì10 feet) long, but was very lightweight, weighing only around 15‚Äì20 kg (33‚Äì44 lbs). It had a slender body, long legs, and sharp teeth, built for speed and agility. Fossil evidence suggests it lived in large groups or packs, since mass graves containing dozens (even hundreds) of individuals have been found, particularly at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico. Its diet consisted mainly of small reptiles, early mammals, and possibly even young dinosaurs. Coelophysis is especially important because it is one of the earliest known theropods, showing traits that would later define the group, such as hollow bones, three-toed feet, and sharp claws. It represents the foundation of the great lineage of meat-eating dinosaurs that eventually gave rise to predators like Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex."

            text: "Mussaurus (‚Äúmouse lizard‚Äù) was a small early sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Late Triassic (~215 million years ago) of Argentina, originally known from fossilized hatchlings, and one of the earliest relatives of the giant sauropods. Mussaurus was first discovered in Patagonia in the 1970s, when paleontologists uncovered tiny skeletons only about 20 cm (8 inches) long, leading them to think it was a miniature dinosaur‚Äîhence the name ‚Äúmouse lizard.‚Äù Later discoveries of adult specimens revealed that Mussaurus grew much larger, up to 3‚Äì4 meters (10‚Äì13 feet) long as an adult. It had a long neck and tail, strong hind legs, and grasping hands, indicating it could walk both on two legs and four. Its teeth were leaf-shaped, suggesting it was primarily herbivorous, feeding on ferns, cycads, and other Triassic plants. Recent fossil discoveries include nesting sites with eggs and multiple age groups, showing that Mussaurus lived in social herds and cared for their young, making it one of the earliest dinosaurs with evidence of complex social behavior. Mussaurus is important because it represents an early step in the evolution toward the massive sauropods of the Jurassic, like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus."

            text: "Plateosaurus was a large early sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Late Triassic (~214‚Äì204 million years ago) of Europe, and one of the first truly large dinosaurs to evolve, paving the way for the giant sauropods of the Jurassic. Plateosaurus reached lengths of 7‚Äì10 meters (23‚Äì33 feet) and could weigh up to 4 tons, making it a giant compared to earlier Triassic dinosaurs. It had a long neck and tail, robust hind limbs, and grasping hands with a large thumb claw. Its leaf-shaped teeth show it was an herbivore, feeding on cycads, conifers, and ferns. It is believed to have been primarily bipedal, walking on two legs, though it could also move on four when feeding. Fossil evidence suggests Plateosaurus grew slowly compared to later sauropods and displayed a degree of growth plasticity‚Äîsome individuals reached massive sizes, while others stayed smaller, possibly due to environmental factors. Plateosaurus fossils are among the most common Triassic dinosaur finds in Europe, especially in Germany, Switzerland, and France, where bonebeds containing hundreds of skeletons have been discovered. This abundance makes it one of the best-studied Triassic dinosaurs. Its importance lies in being a key transitional dinosaur between small, agile early saurischians and the colossal sauropods of the Jurassic, showing the early experiments in size and body structure that would later dominate the Mesozoic."

            text: "Riojasaurus was a large sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Late Triassic (~221‚Äì210 million years ago) of Argentina, and one of the earliest truly large plant-eating dinosaurs in South America. Riojasaurus grew to about 9‚Äì10 meters (30‚Äì33 feet) long and weighed up to 3‚Äì4 tons, making it one of the biggest dinosaurs of its time. Unlike some of its relatives (Plateosaurus or Mussaurus), Riojasaurus was more quadrupedal‚Äîits body was heavy, with a long neck and tail, so it likely spent much of its time walking on all fours rather than rearing on two legs. It had leaf-shaped teeth adapted for stripping vegetation, and its relatively short forelimbs compared to its hind limbs suggest it may have been a slow mover. Fossils have been found in the Los Colorados Formation of La Rioja Province, Argentina, which is how it got its name. Riojasaurus is important because it represents one of the earliest large-bodied sauropodomorphs before the appearance of the giant Jurassic sauropods. Its anatomy shows how early dinosaurs were already experimenting with the large, heavy, quadrupedal body plan that would later dominate the Mesozoic with sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus."

            text: "Gojirasaurus (‚ÄúGodzilla lizard‚Äù) was a large theropod dinosaur from the Late Triassic (~228‚Äì210 million years ago) of North America, and one of the earliest known big predatory dinosaurs. Gojirasaurus is known from partial fossils discovered in New Mexico (Chinle Formation). It was estimated to reach 5‚Äì6 meters (16‚Äì20 feet) long, making it one of the largest Triassic theropods and far bigger than most of its contemporaries like Coelophysis. It belonged to the coelophysoid group, an early branch of theropods, and had the typical build of a predator. Lightweight, bipedal frame built for speed, Sharp, serrated teeth for cutting flesh and Strong claws and grasping hands for capturing prey. Because of its size, Gojirasaurus may have been an apex predator in its environment, preying on smaller reptiles, early dinosaurs, and possibly juvenile sauropodomorphs. The dinosaur was named in 1997 by paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter after the famous Japanese movie monster Godzilla, highlighting its large size compared to other Triassic theropods."

It measured around 3 meters (10 feet) long and weighed about 50 kilograms (110 lbs). This dinosaur had a long neck and tail, though still shorter than those of later sauropodomorphs, and strong hind limbs that suggest it was primarily bipedal but also capable of moving on all fours. Its grasping hands featured a large thumb claw, likely useful for pulling down vegetation, while its leaf-shaped teeth indicate a diet of plants with the possibility of occasional small prey. The name Pantydraco means ‚ÄúPant-y-ffynnon dragon,‚Äù referring to the Welsh quarry where its fossils were discovered. Originally considered a juvenile Thecodontosaurus, it was later identified as a distinct genus."

It reached up to 6 meters (20 feet) in length and weighed between 210 and 350 kilograms (460‚Äì770 lbs). This lightly built predator walked on two strong hind legs, had a long tail for balance, and sharp, serrated teeth suited for slicing flesh. Its forelimbs were shorter but equipped with large claws, making them effective for grasping and holding prey. Fossils discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation revealed that Herrerasaurus was a fast and agile carnivore, likely preying on smaller herbivorous reptiles and early dinosaurs."

It measured around 1.5 to 2 meters (5 to 7 feet) in length and weighed approximately 20 kilograms (44 lbs). With its slender body, long tail, and relatively large hands, Saturnalia was likely both bipedal and quadrupedal, moving easily on two legs but able to use all fours when feeding. Its teeth suggest an omnivorous diet, consisting mainly of plants but possibly including small prey. As one of the earliest sauropodomorphs, it shows a transitional body plan between the small, agile ancestors of dinosaurs and the massive, plant-eating sauropods that would later dominate the Jurassic period."

With its slender body, long legs, and lightweight build, it was well adapted for speed and agility, likely relying on quick movements to catch prey or evade larger predators. Its sharp teeth and grasping hands suggest a carnivorous diet, feeding on insects, lizards, and other small vertebrates. The long tail provided balance while running, and its delicate skeleton reflects a highly mobile lifestyle."
