            title: "🦕 Ankylosaurus",
            text: "Ankylosaurus was a heavily armored dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 68 to 66 million years ago, with fossils found in North America. It was one of the last and largest ankylosaurids, reaching up to 8 meters (26 feet) long and weighing over 6 tons. Its body was covered in thick osteoderms—bony plates embedded in the skin—that formed an almost impenetrable shield against predators. The most distinctive feature of Ankylosaurus was its massive tail club, made of fused bony knobs, which could deliver powerful blows strong enough to break bones. Despite its fearsome defenses, it was a slow-moving herbivore, feeding on low-growing plants like ferns, cycads, and shrubs. Its wide, low-slung body and leaf-shaped teeth made it well suited for ground-level grazing. Living alongside giants like Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, Ankylosaurus represents one of the most iconic armored dinosaurs of the Cretaceous landscape."

            title: "🦖 Abelisaurus", 
            text: "Abelisaurus was a large theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 85 to 70 million years ago, in what is now South America. It reached an estimated length of 7 to 9 meters (23–30 feet) and weighed roughly 1 to 2 tons, making it one of the apex predators of its ecosystem. Its skull was tall and short, with robust jaws filled with sharp, serrated teeth, while the rest of its body was relatively stocky with powerful hind limbs, suggesting it was capable of swift bursts of speed when hunting. Unlike many other large theropods, Abelisaurus had tiny, almost vestigial arms, indicating it relied almost entirely on its jaws and head for capturing prey. Fossil evidence suggests it preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs, such as sauropods and ornithopods, dominating the Late Cretaceous landscapes of South America. Its distinctive build represents the specialized abelisaurid lineage that flourished in Gondwanan continents during the Cretaceous."

            title: "🦖 Achillobator",
            text: "Achillobator was a large dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 90 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia. It measured approximately 5 to 6 meters (16–20 feet) in length and weighed around 250 to 300 kilograms (550–660 lbs), making it one of the largest known members of the “raptor” family. Like other dromaeosaurids, Achillobator had a long, stiffened tail for balance, strong hind limbs with a large, sickle-shaped claw on each second toe, and powerful forelimbs with sharp claws for grasping prey. Its skull was relatively large, equipped with serrated teeth ideal for slicing flesh. Fossil evidence suggests that Achillobator was a fast and agile predator, capable of hunting small to medium-sized dinosaurs and other vertebrates. Its name, meaning “Achilles’ hero,” reflects the well-developed hindlimb muscles inferred from its fossilized leg bones, emphasizing its speed and predatory adaptations."
        },
		        3: {
            title: "🦖 Alioramus",
            text: "Alioramus was a medium-sized tyrannosaurid theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 70 to 66 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia. It measured approximately 5 to 6 meters (16–20 feet) in length and weighed around 500 to 700 kilograms (1,100–1,500 lbs), making it lighter and more slender than its larger relatives like Tyrannosaurus rex. Alioramus had a long, low skull with a row of small bumps or horns along the snout, which may have been used for display or species recognition. Its teeth were sharp and recurved, suited for slicing flesh, and its body was built for speed and agility rather than brute force. This combination of features suggests that Alioramus may have hunted smaller prey or juveniles of larger dinosaurs, relying on swiftness and precision to capture its meals. Fossil evidence from Mongolia places it within the tyrannosaurid family, illustrating the diversity of this group in Asia during the Late Cretaceous."

            title: "🦕 Albertaceratops",
            text: "Albertaceratops was a ceratopsid dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 78 to 76 million years ago, in what is now Alberta, Canada. It measured approximately 6 meters (20 feet) in length and weighed around 3 tons. Like other ceratopsids, it had a large frill at the back of its skull and multiple horns, including long brow horns above its eyes and a smaller nasal horn, which may have been used for defense, species recognition, or display. Its beak-like mouth and rows of shearing teeth were adapted for chewing tough vegetation such as ferns and cycads. Fossils indicate that Albertaceratops lived in herds, which may have offered protection against predators. Its combination of primitive and derived ceratopsid features makes it an important species for understanding the evolution and diversity of horned dinosaurs in North America during the Late Cretaceous."

            title: "🦕 Aralosaurus",
            text: "Aralosaurus was a hadrosaurid (“duck-billed”) dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 83 to 70 million years ago, in what is now Kazakhstan. It measured approximately 7 to 8 meters (23–26 feet) in length and weighed around 2 to 3 tons. Its most distinctive feature was the prominent hollow crest on the top of its skull, which likely served for vocalization, display, or species recognition. As a herbivore, Aralosaurus had a broad, flattened beak suited for cropping plants and rows of tightly packed teeth for grinding tough vegetation, such as ferns, conifers, and flowering plants. Fossil evidence suggests it lived in herds, which may have provided protection against predators, and its skeletal structure indicates it could move both bipedally and quadrupedally, depending on speed or feeding behavior. Aralosaurus represents an early member of the lambeosaurine hadrosaurids, showing the development of cranial crests that became more elaborate in later species."

            title: "🦖 Baryonyx",
            text: "Baryonyx was a large spinosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period, around 130 to 125 million years ago, in what is now England and possibly parts of Spain. It measured about 9 to 10 meters (30–33 feet) in length and weighed roughly 1.2 to 1.7 tons. Baryonyx had a long, narrow snout filled with conical, finely serrated teeth, ideal for catching fish, its primary diet, though it likely also preyed on small dinosaurs and carrion. Its forelimbs were unusually large for a theropod, ending in massive claws, with the first claw on each hand measuring nearly 30 centimeters (12 inches) long, which it may have used to hook and hold prey. Fossil evidence, including fish scales in the stomach area of specimens, confirms its semi-aquatic lifestyle and specialized piscivorous hunting strategies. With its unique combination of adaptations, Baryonyx stands out among theropods as a specialized predator bridging the gap between land and water ecosystems during the Early Cretaceous."

            title: "🦖 Citipati",
            text: "Citipati was a large oviraptorid dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 75 to 71 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia. It measured about 2.5 meters (8 feet) in length and weighed roughly 20 to 30 kilograms (44–66 lbs). Citipati had a toothless beak, a crest on top of its head, and strong, grasping hands, which suggest it fed on a combination of small animals, eggs, and plant material. Fossil evidence shows remarkable nesting behavior, with adult specimens preserved sitting on top of nests of eggs in brooding postures, indicating complex reproductive care similar to modern birds. Its body was lightly built with long legs and a flexible tail, making it agile and capable of quick movements. As one of the best-known oviraptorids, Citipati provides crucial insight into the behavior and evolution of feathered dinosaurs, particularly their nesting and parental care strategies."

            title: "🦖 Deinocheirus",
            text: "Deinocheirus was a giant theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 70 to 66 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia. It measured an enormous 11 to 12 meters (36–39 feet) in length and weighed around 6 to 7 tons, making it one of the largest ornithomimosaurs ever discovered. Unlike the typical slender “ostrich-mimic” dinosaurs, Deinocheirus had massive, clawed forelimbs, a broad, humped back, and a wide, duck-bill-like snout suited for consuming plants, small animals, and possibly fish. Its body structure, including a long, flexible tail and powerful legs, suggests it was capable of both walking and running, though not as fast as smaller relatives. Fossil evidence, including stomach contents, indicates an omnivorous diet, and its unusual combination of traits has made it one of the most enigmatic dinosaurs, bridging the gap between theropods specialized for speed and those adapted for diverse feeding strategies."

            text: "Edmontosaurus was a large hadrosaurid (“duck-billed”) dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 73 to 66 million years ago, in what is now North America. It measured up to 12 meters (39 feet) in length and could weigh around 4 to 5 tons. Edmontosaurus had a broad, flattened snout with hundreds of tightly packed teeth arranged in dental batteries, ideal for grinding tough vegetation such as ferns, conifers, and flowering plants. Its body was robust and well-suited for both bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion, allowing it to graze at different heights depending on food availability. Fossil evidence shows that Edmontosaurus often lived in herds, which likely provided protection against large predators like Tyrannosaurus rex. Some mummified specimens preserve skin impressions, giving a rare glimpse of its scaly body covering and confirming it had a tough, textured hide."

            text: "Gallimimus was a large, fast-running theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 70 to 66 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia. It measured approximately 6 meters (20 feet) in length and weighed around 400 to 500 kilograms (880–1,100 lbs). Its body was lightly built with long legs, a long neck, and a small, toothless beak, giving it a striking resemblance to modern ostriches. Gallimimus likely fed on a varied diet, including plants, small animals, and insects, using its beak to peck and forage. Its long legs and lightweight frame suggest it was one of the fastest dinosaurs of its time, capable of sprinting to escape predators or catch prey. Fossil evidence also indicates it may have lived in groups, providing safety in numbers while navigating the open plains of Late Cretaceous Mongolia."

It measured approximately 12 to 13 meters (39–43 feet) in length and weighed around 8 tons, making it one of the largest terrestrial carnivores of its time. Its skull was long and narrow, filled with serrated teeth designed for slicing through the flesh of large herbivorous dinosaurs, such as titanosaurs. Giganotosaurus had powerful hind limbs and a long tail that provided balance, but its forelimbs were short with two clawed fingers, indicating it relied primarily on its jaws for hunting. Fossil evidence suggests it was an apex predator in its ecosystem, capable of taking down enormous prey and dominating the Late Cretaceous landscapes of South America. Its size and predatory adaptations make it one of the most formidable theropods known from Gondwana."
