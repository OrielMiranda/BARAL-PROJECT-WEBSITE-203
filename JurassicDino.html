            title: "🦕 Compsognathus",
            text: "Compsognathus was a small theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period about 150 million years ago in what is now Germany and France. It measured about 1 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet) in length and weighed roughly 3 to 4 kilograms (6 to 9 lbs), making it one of the smallest known dinosaurs of its time. With its long, slender legs, lightweight frame, and elongated tail, Compsognathus was built for speed and agility. Its sharp teeth and clawed hands indicate a carnivorous diet, primarily consisting of small vertebrates such as lizards, as evidenced by fossilized stomach contents. The fine preservation of its fossils has provided detailed insights into the anatomy of small theropods and how they might have moved and hunted."
        },
        1: {
            title: "🦕 Brachytrachelopan", 
            text: "Brachytrachelopan was a unique sauropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period, around 150 million years ago, discovered in Argentina. Unlike most sauropods, it had an unusually short neck, measuring only about 30% of its total body length, which gave it its name meaning “short-necked Pan.” It grew to about 10–11 meters (33–36 feet) in length, much smaller than giant sauropods like Diplodocus or Brachiosaurus. Its short neck suggests it specialized in feeding on low-growing plants, unlike its long-necked relatives that browsed high vegetation. Fossils from the Patagonia region reveal it belonged to the diplodocoid group of sauropods, but it developed this unusual body plan as an adaptation to its environment, where ground-level vegetation was plentiful."
        },
        2: {
            title: "🦕 Dilophosaurus",
            text: "Dilophosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic period about 193 million years ago in what is now North America. It reached lengths of around 6 to 7 meters (20 to 23 feet) and weighed approximately 400 to 500 kilograms (880 to 1,100 lbs). This predator is easily recognized by the pair of thin, arched crests on its skull, which were likely used for display rather than combat. Its body was lightly built, with long legs adapted for running, sharp teeth for tearing flesh, and clawed hands for grasping prey. Fossil evidence suggests it was an active carnivore that may have hunted small to medium-sized animals or scavenged when the opportunity arose."
        },
		        3: {
            title: "🦕 Stegosaurus",
            text: "Stegosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, about 155 to 150 million years ago, in what is now North America. It grew up to 9 meters (30 feet) in length and weighed around 5 to 7 tons. Stegosaurus is most recognizable for the two rows of large, bony plates running along its back and the four long spikes at the end of its tail, often referred to as the “thagomizer,” which likely served as a defensive weapon. Its small head, short neck, and peg-like teeth suggest it fed on low-lying plants such as ferns and cycads. Despite its massive body, it had a remarkably small brain compared to its size, but its specialized anatomy made it one of the most iconic and distinctive dinosaurs of the Jurassic era."
        },
		        4: {
            title: "🦕 Patagosaurus",
            text: "Patagosaurus was a large sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Middle Jurassic period, around 165 million years ago, in what is now Argentina. It measured about 18 meters (59 feet) in length and weighed an estimated 12 to 16 tons. Like other sauropods, it had a long neck and tail with a bulky, barrel-shaped body supported by four sturdy legs. Its teeth were adapted for stripping leaves from trees, suggesting it fed primarily on conifers and other Jurassic vegetation. Fossils discovered in Patagonia indicate it was one of the earliest known giant sauropods from South America, representing an important step in the evolution of these long-necked dinosaurs."
        },
		        5: {
            title: "🦕 Vulcanodon",
            text: "Vulcanodon was an early sauropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago, discovered in Zimbabwe. It measured around 6.5 meters (21 feet) in length, making it relatively small compared to later sauropods. Its body was sturdy with a long neck and tail, though shorter and less specialized than its giant descendants. Vulcanodon had peg-like teeth suited for stripping leaves, suggesting a herbivorous diet focused on low to mid-height vegetation. Fossil evidence shows it lived in a volcanic environment, which is reflected in its name meaning “volcano tooth.” As one of the earliest known true sauropods, it represents an important stage in the transition from smaller prosauropods to the massive long-necked giants of the Jurassic and Cretaceous."
        },
		        6: {
            title: "🦕 Anchisaurus",
            text: "Anchisaurus was a small, early sauropodomorph dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic period, around 200 to 195 million years ago, in what is now North America. It measured about 2 to 4 meters (6.5 to 13 feet) in length and weighed roughly 20 to 30 kilograms (44 to 66 lbs), making it much smaller than its later sauropod relatives. Its body was lightly built, with a long neck and tail, and it could probably move both on two legs and four. Anchisaurus had leaf-shaped teeth suited for a herbivorous diet, feeding on plants such as ferns and cycads, though some paleontologists suggest it may have been omnivorous. Fossils found in Connecticut are among the first dinosaur remains ever described in North America, giving Anchisaurus historical importance in early paleontology."

            title: "🦕 Brachiosaurus",
            text: "Brachiosaurus was a massive sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 154 to 150 million years ago, in what is now North America. It could grow up to 25 meters (82 feet) in length and weigh over 40 tons. Unlike most other sauropods, Brachiosaurus had longer front legs than hind legs, giving it a giraffe-like posture with its neck towering high above the ground. This unique build allowed it to browse on tall trees, feeding on conifers, ginkgoes, and other high vegetation that many other herbivores could not reach. Its long neck, small head, and spoon-shaped teeth were adapted for stripping leaves, while its massive body and pillar-like legs supported its enormous weight. Fossil evidence suggests it lived in herds or loose groups, dominating the floodplains and forested regions of the Jurassic landscape."

		        8: {
            title: "🦕 Ornitholestes",
            text: "Ornitholestes was a small theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, about 154 to 150 million years ago, in what is now North America. It measured around 2 meters (6.5 feet) in length and weighed roughly 10 to 15 kilograms (22 to 33 lbs). Lightly built with long legs and a slender body, it was likely a fast and agile predator. Its skull was narrow with sharp, recurved teeth suited for seizing small prey, such as lizards, mammals, and possibly young dinosaurs. A flexible neck and long tail helped it balance while hunting, and its forelimbs had strong claws for grasping. Fossil remains suggest Ornitholestes was an active, opportunistic hunter in the Jurassic ecosystem, possibly filling a role similar to small carnivorous mammals in later eras."

		        9: {
            title: "🦕 Mamenchisaurus",
            text: "Mamenchisaurus was a giant sauropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period, about 160 to 145 million years ago, discovered in China. It is most famous for its extraordinarily long neck, which made up nearly half of its total body length. Some species reached up to 22–26 meters (72–85 feet), with the longest necks extending over 15 meters (49 feet), making it one of the longest-necked animals ever to exist. Its body was massive but relatively lighter compared to some other sauropods, with a long tail and column-like legs that supported its enormous size. The peg-like teeth indicate it fed on vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and conifers, browsing from both mid and high levels of the forest. Fossil discoveries show several species of Mamenchisaurus, suggesting it was a successful genus that thrived in lush Jurassic landscapes of Asia."
        },
		        10: {
            title: "🦕 Diplodocus",
            text: "Diplodocus was a long-necked sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 154 to 150 million years ago, in what is now North America. It was among the longest dinosaurs ever discovered, with some individuals reaching up to 27 meters (88 feet) in length, though it was relatively lighter in build compared to other giants like Brachiosaurus. Its neck was extremely long and flexible, while its whip-like tail may have been used for defense or communication. Unlike high-browsing sauropods, Diplodocus is thought to have fed mainly at lower levels, sweeping its neck across the ground to strip ferns, cycads, and conifers with its peg-shaped teeth. Its long, pillar-like legs supported its massive body, and trackway evidence suggests it may have lived in herds. Fossil remains of Diplodocus are among the most complete sauropod skeletons ever found, making it one of the best-studied dinosaurs."

		        11: {
            title: "🦕 Kentrosaurus",
            text: "Kentrosaurus was a stegosaurid dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, about 155 to 150 million years ago, in what is now Tanzania, Africa. It was a medium-sized herbivore, reaching about 4.5 meters (15 feet) in length, and was related to the more famous Stegosaurus. Its body was covered with two rows of bony plates running along its neck and back, which transitioned into long, sharp spikes toward the tail. These spikes, especially the large pairs at the end of the tail, served as formidable defensive weapons against predators. Compared to Stegosaurus, Kentrosaurus had smaller plates and more spikes, giving it a heavily armored appearance. It fed on low-lying vegetation such as ferns, cycads, and horsetails, using its small head and beak-like mouth to crop plants close to the ground. Fossil evidence suggests Kentrosaurus lived in herds, offering protection through group defense in the dinosaur-rich environments of Jurassic Africa."

            text: "Apatosaurus was a gigantic sauropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, about 154 to 150 million years ago, in the floodplains of North America. It measured around 22 to 23 meters (72–75 feet) in length and weighed up to 30 tons, making it one of the largest land animals of its time. Its body was massive and heavily built, with a long, muscular neck, a barrel-shaped torso, and a lengthy tail that likely served as a whip for defense or communication. Unlike the more slender Diplodocus, Apatosaurus had thicker neck vertebrae and a sturdier overall frame, giving it a powerful and stocky appearance. Its teeth were peg-like, adapted for stripping leaves from conifers, cycads, and ferns, which it consumed in enormous amounts to sustain its size. Trackway evidence suggests that it may have lived in herds, moving together across Jurassic landscapes, shaping ecosystems as a dominant plant-eater of its era."
        },
		        13: {
            title: "🦕 Megalosaurus",
            text: "Megalosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur that lived during the Middle Jurassic period, around 166 million years ago, in what is now England. It was one of the first dinosaurs ever discovered and scientifically described, with its fossils studied as early as the early 19th century, making it the first dinosaur to be formally named. Megalosaurus was a carnivorous predator, estimated to reach about 9 meters (30 feet) in length, with a powerful build, strong legs, and sharp teeth designed for tearing flesh. Its skull was large and equipped with serrated teeth, suggesting it preyed on other large dinosaurs and possibly scavenged when necessary. As an apex predator of its time, it dominated the ecosystems of Jurassic Europe, hunting herbivorous dinosaurs and other contemporaneous reptiles. Fossil remains are fragmentary, but they provide enough evidence to confirm that Megalosaurus was a robust and fearsome carnivore, setting the foundation for the study of many later theropod discoveries."

            text: "Cryolophosaurus was a medium-sized theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic period, about 193 million years ago, in what is now Antarctica. It measured around 6 to 7 meters (20–23 feet) in length and weighed roughly 450 to 500 kilograms (1,000 pounds). Its most distinctive feature was the unusual crest on top of its head, which ran across the skull from side to side like a wave or pompadour. This crest was too fragile for combat and is thought to have been used for display, either to attract mates or to signal to others of its kind. Cryolophosaurus had strong jaws filled with serrated teeth, indicating a carnivorous diet that likely included other dinosaurs and early reptiles. Its discovery in Antarctica revealed that large predatory dinosaurs lived even in high-latitude environments when the continent was covered by forests and had a much milder climate. The fossils also make it one of the earliest known large theropods, providing important insight into the early evolution of carnivorous dinosaurs."

            text: "Ceratosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 150 million years ago, in North America, Portugal, and possibly Africa. It reached lengths of about 6 to 7 meters (20–23 feet) and weighed between 500 to 1,000 kilograms (1,100–2,200 pounds). One of its most distinctive features was the prominent horn on its snout, along with smaller horns above its eyes, giving it a striking appearance. It had a long, deep skull filled with blade-like serrated teeth designed for slicing flesh, and its body was relatively slender compared to other Jurassic predators. Unlike Allosaurus, its contemporary rival, Ceratosaurus had a long, muscular tail and unusually large, flexible arms equipped with sharp claws, suggesting it may have used them effectively while hunting. Its diet likely consisted of smaller and medium-sized dinosaurs, as well as fish and crocodile-like reptiles, supported by fossil evidence of semi-aquatic habits. As a predator, it occupied a unique ecological niche, living alongside other large carnivores but thriving by exploiting different food sources."

            text: "Allosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, about 155 to 145 million years ago, in what is now North America, Portugal, and parts of Africa. It was one of the most successful predators of its time, reaching lengths of 8 to 10 meters (26–33 feet) and weighing up to 2 metric tons. Its skull was large, with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth designed for slicing through flesh, and it had short but powerful arms equipped with three-fingered hands tipped with long claws. Unlike heavier predators, Allosaurus was relatively lightweight and agile, which likely made it a fast and active hunter. It probably preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs such as Stegosaurus, Camarasaurus, and young Diplodocus, using ambush tactics or pack behavior to take down prey larger than itself. Fossil evidence of healed injuries suggests that both predators and prey engaged in violent encounters, with Allosaurus often surviving serious wounds. As one of the most common carnivores of the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus played a central role in Jurassic ecosystems, balancing against the massive herbivore populations that dominated the landscape."

            text: "Archaeopteryx was a small, feathered dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago, in what is now southern Germany. Measuring around 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length and weighing less than 1 kilogram (2 pounds), it is famous for displaying a mixture of reptilian and avian traits, making it a key transitional species between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Its body was covered in well-developed flight feathers similar to modern birds, yet it retained dinosaur-like characteristics such as teeth, clawed fingers, and a long bony tail. The wings suggest it was capable of gliding or limited powered flight, though not with the efficiency of modern birds. Archaeopteryx likely lived in a subtropical island environment and may have fed on small prey like insects, lizards, and other vertebrates. Its discovery in the 19th century, shortly after Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, provided crucial fossil evidence supporting the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds, cementing its role as one of the most significant and iconic fossils ever found."

Unlike dinosaurs, it belonged to the group of flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, making it one of the earliest scientifically described prehistoric fliers. It had a wingspan ranging from about 50 centimeters (20 inches) to over 1 meter (3.3 feet), with wings formed by a membrane of skin stretching from its elongated fourth finger down to its body. Its skull was long and narrow, filled with sharp, conical teeth that suggest a diet consisting mainly of fish and small animals. Pterodactylus had a lightweight body and a long, flexible neck, allowing it to snap quickly at prey. Some fossils also show evidence of soft tissues and crests on the head, which may have varied between individuals and could have been used for display or species recognition. It inhabited coastal and lagoon environments, where it likely soared over the water to hunt. As one of the first pterosaurs ever discovered and named in the late 18th century, Pterodactylus has long been a symbol of flying reptiles and continues to be one of the most iconic pterosaur fossils."

Unlike the later short-tailed pterosaurs such as Pterodactylus and Pteranodon, Rhamphorhynchus was distinguished by its long, stiffened tail ending in a diamond-shaped vane, which may have helped with balance and maneuverability during flight. It had a wingspan ranging from about 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet), with wings made of a thin membrane supported by an elongated fourth finger. Its jaws were filled with forward-pointing, sharp teeth ideal for catching slippery prey, and fossil evidence strongly suggests it fed primarily on fish, often hunting over coastal waters and lagoons. Some fossil remains even preserve stomach contents and fish bones, confirming its diet. With a lightweight skeleton and adaptations for gliding and powered flight, Rhamphorhynchus was well-suited to a life spent soaring over Jurassic seas. Its well-preserved fossils, including impressions of wing membranes and soft tissues, have made it one of the best-studied early pterosaurs and an important window into the evolution of flight in reptiles."

It had a wingspan of about 1.5 meters (5 feet) and was notable for its large, bulky skull compared to its body size, giving it a somewhat awkward appearance. The skull was equipped with two distinct types of teeth—hence the name Dimorphodon (“two-form tooth”)—with long, fang-like teeth at the front for catching prey and smaller, more numerous teeth at the back for crushing. This suggests a varied diet that may have included fish, small vertebrates, and possibly insects. Unlike later pterosaurs that were adapted for long-distance soaring, Dimorphodon had relatively short, broad wings, meaning it was likely not a strong glider but instead adept at quick bursts of flight. It also had strong legs and a long, stiffened tail, which may have helped it balance while moving on the ground or climbing. Fossil evidence suggests it may have nested in coastal cliffs and hunted along shorelines, making it one of the earliest pterosaurs adapted to a mixed lifestyle of flight and terrestrial movement."

Unlike modern crocodiles, Dakosaurus was fully adapted to life in the ocean, with a streamlined body, paddle-like limbs, and a powerful tail for swimming. It grew up to 4–5 meters (13–16 feet) long and had a robust skull with large, serrated teeth, earning it the nickname “the Jurassic chainsaw crocodile.” These teeth were very different from the slender, fish-catching teeth of many marine reptiles, suggesting that Dakosaurus was an apex predator that hunted large prey such as fish, marine reptiles, and possibly other crocodile-like creatures. Its adaptations for open-water life make it one of the most specialized marine crocodyliforms, showing convergent evolution with other large marine predators of its time."

It was a fearsome marine predator, with estimates suggesting it reached lengths of 6–7 meters (20–23 feet), though some fragmentary remains hint at the possibility of even larger individuals. Liopleurodon had a huge, elongated skull filled with sharp, conical teeth, perfectly adapted for seizing slippery prey. Its powerful jaws and strong bite allowed it to hunt large fish, ichthyosaurs, and other marine reptiles. Unlike long-necked plesiosaurs, which likely hunted smaller prey, Liopleurodon relied on ambush tactics, using bursts of speed powered by its four strong, paddle-like flippers to capture large animals. Its highly developed sense of smell, inferred from its anatomy, suggests it could detect prey over long distances in the open ocean. With its combination of size, strength, and hunting adaptations, Liopleurodon was one of the apex predators of Jurassic seas."

Unlike modern crocodiles, it was fully adapted to an oceanic lifestyle, with a sleek, streamlined body, paddle-like limbs, and a long, finned tail that made it resemble a marine reptile more than a crocodile. It grew about 3 meters (10 feet) in length and had a relatively narrow skull with long, pointed teeth, suggesting it primarily fed on fish, squid, and other small marine creatures. Unlike its bulkier relative Dakosaurus, which hunted large prey, Metriorhynchus was a swift pursuit predator, relying on speed and agility in open water. Remarkably, fossil evidence indicates that it may have given live birth rather than laying eggs, since returning to land to nest would have been difficult for its body shape. With its unique adaptations, Metriorhynchus represents one of the clearest examples of crocodile relatives evolving to thrive entirely in the sea."
