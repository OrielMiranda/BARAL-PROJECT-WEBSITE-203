                <h3>252 – 201 million years ago</h3>
                <p>The Triassic Period marks the beginning of the Mesozoic Era — often called the “Age of Reptiles.”
                     It lasted about 51 million years, from 252 million years ago (mya) to 201 mya. It was a time of
                      dramatic recovery, new beginnings, and evolutionary breakthroughs after Earth’s worst mass extinction.</p>

                <h3>The Great Dying (Permian-Triassic Extinction)</h3>
                <p>At the start of the Triassic, Earth was nearly lifeless. Around 90–95% of marine species and 70% of land
                     vertebrates had been wiped out in the extinction event 252 mya, likely caused by massive volcanic eruptions
                      in Siberia, which released toxic gases, triggered global warming, and acidified the oceans.</p>

                <p>The supercontinent Pangaea stretched from pole to pole, surrounded by the vast Panthalassa Ocean.
                     Much of its interior was hot, dry desert, while coastal regions had seasonal rainfall. The poles were
                      warm and lacked permanent ice caps.</p>

                <h3>Life on Land:</h3>
                <p>Recovery was slow. The early Triassic was dominated by hardy survivors like lycophytes (club mosses) and 
                    glossopterids in some southern regions. Amphibians and a few reptiles survived, but ecosystems were unstable.</p>

                <p>Marine ecosystems were devastated. Coral reefs had collapsed. Slowly, new groups emerged,Ammonoids (relatives 
                    of squids) began to diversify again. Ichthyosaurs, early dolphin-like reptiles, appeared and quickly adapted
                     as top marine predators. Small fish and bivalves (clams, mussels) became more common.</p>

                <p>By the middle Triassic, climates stabilized. Rainfall increased in some regions, giving rise to more forests 
                    along coastal zones. Deserts still dominated the interior of Pangaea, but ecosystems were more balanced.</p>
